# About 

<img align="right" src="https://ozgurseker.github.io/blog/docs/assets/img/ppsmll.jpg">

Hello, 

My name is Ozgur Seker. I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at University of Pennsylvania. My doctoral research was involving macro economic theory, scientific computation, data extracting, data cleaning, and causal inference. As I transition to the next phase of my career, I am eager to leverage my analytical expertise and experience in data science, quantitative research, or consulting roles.

# Professional Interest

## Quantitative Finance

I am interested in quantitative finance and wish to work in this area professionally. I have been managing my own portfolio as well as my parents for last 8 years. Currently, I am developing simple tools for myself to help my trading decisions in the stock market. I developed backtesting tools, trading bots for IBKR, automated theoretical benchmark reports for daily picks, and technical analysis summary reports so far. I love coding, following the stock market, and managing investments. 

## Teaching

I love teaching. Before completing my PhD, I will have been taught 5 different courses as the sole instructor at Penn LPS. (4x Introduction to Microeconomics, 1x Introduction to Macroeconomics). I had experience as a TA for more than 6 years, but being the instructor was completely different. It was so stressful in the beginning and I was so nervous. However, it become easier over time. I loved it so much. I tried to take it whenever there is an opportunity. Fortunately, I had this opportunity much more than a regular PhD student. 

# Hobbies

I wanted to share how I spend my free time. I am a passionate table tennis player at amateur level.
