# About 

Hello, 

My name is Ozgur Seker. I am currently a 5th-year Ph.D. student at UPenn Econ. 

I am planning to use this page as my blog about everything. 

# Professional Interest

## Quantitative Finance

I am interested in quantitative finance and wish to work in this area professionally. Currently, I am developing simple tools for myself to help my trading decisions in the stock market. I developed backtesting tools, trading bots for IBKR, automated theoretical benchmark reports for daily picks, and technical analysis summary reports so far. I love coding, following the stock market, and managing my investments. 

## Teaching

I love teaching. At the end of Summer 2023, I will have been taught 4 different courses as the sole instructor at Penn LPS. (3x Introduction to Microeconomics, 1x Introduction to Macroeconomics). I had experience as a TA for more than 6 years, but it was my first time as an instructor last summer. It was so stressful in the beginning and I was so nervous. However, I loved it so much. I tried to take it whenever there is an opportunity. Fortunately, I had this opportunity much more than a regular PhD student. 

## Ongoing Research Project

In my third year paper, I developed a theoretical model where firms are competing dynamically through investment decisions and political connection decisions under exogenous political events(i.e. elections, and political turnovers). I simulated my theoretical model and showed the simulation results are consistent with empirical evidence in the literature about politically connected firms, the relation of corruption and economic growth. 

Currently, I am developing my own dataset from Turkey(1998-2008) to work on the same topic empirically. I might talk about this in a post in detail maybe.
