# About 

<img align="right" src="https://ozgurseker.github.io/blog/docs/assets/img/ppsmll.jpg" width="354" height="357">

Hello, 

My name is Ozgur Seker. I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at University of Pennsylvania. My doctoral research was involving macro economic theory, scientific computation, data extracting, data cleaning, and causal inference. As I transition to the next phase of my career, I am eager to leverage my analytical expertise and experience in data science, quantitative research, or consulting roles.

# Professional Interest

## Quantitative Finance

I am interested in quantitative finance and wish to work in this area professionally. I have been managing my own portfolio as well as my parents for last 8 years. Currently, I am developing simple tools for myself to help my trading decisions in the stock market. I developed backtesting tools, trading bots for IBKR, automated theoretical benchmark reports for daily picks, and technical analysis summary reports so far. I love coding, following the stock market, and managing investments. 

## Teaching

I love teaching. Before completing my PhD, I will have been taught 5 different courses as the sole instructor at Penn LPS. (4x Introduction to Microeconomics, 1x Introduction to Macroeconomics). I had experience as a TA for more than 6 years, but being the instructor was completely different. It was so stressful in the beginning and I was so nervous. However, it become easier over time. I loved it so much. I tried to take it whenever there is an opportunity. Fortunately, I had this opportunity much more than a regular PhD student. 

# Extracurricular Activities

I wanted to share how I spend my free time. 

## Table Tennis

I am a passionate table tennis player at competitive level. I was the captain of table tennis team in my college between 2012 and 2016. I had organized college level tournaments and competed in college level national championships. I had played for the Penn's table tennis team and still playing in the local clubs.  

## NBA Fantasy basketball 

Okay I follow basketball, NBA and Euroleague. However being a fantasy basketball player is a completely different thing. I have been playing fantasy basketball since 2017 with a group of friends. It is the closest thing to manage an investment portfolio. You have follow stats, trends, news, and need to decide which players to invest in long run and short run. Moreover, you have to trash talk and have fun with your friends about it. 

## Age of Empires 2

25 years old, but still the best RTS game ever. I love watching pro-level games and tournaments, espacially when T90 casts them. Following the story of a match, macro and micro level decision making and how strategies evolve during the match. It really appeals me. Even though I am a better than average player (~1200 ELO), I consider myself more of a fan than a player. 

## Classical Kemence and Music

It is a classical instrument from Istanbul, Turkey. I was impressed by its sound when I was in high school. I was always into the music with my guitar and keyboard, but I decided to learn to play classical kemence in my college years. I have been playing since 2013. I played in classical music communities at TOBB ETU and Koc Uni. I also uploaded some of my work/covers on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@fuzzyrecords8314) and [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/schked)
