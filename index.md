title: Welcome to my blog
---
In this blog, I will try to share what I have learned/coded recently with explanations. It will be like a diary to myself that I could turn back and remember whenever I need, also a helper for people faced similar problems with me. Not only for scientific or coding purposes, I might also use it for opinions, critics and everything else.
